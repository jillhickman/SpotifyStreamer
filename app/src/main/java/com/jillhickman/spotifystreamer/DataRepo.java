 * Created by jillhickman on 6/30/15.
 *Created this class so that the data can be separate from the view.
 * According to the model view controller pattern.
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller
 * In my case, the controller is the search button on the keyboard, and the
 * view is the listview and the adapter.
